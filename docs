// I am not one to consider myself a developer, as I'm (by my perspective) not skilled/knowledgeable with programming languages/logic/mechanisms. It's reasonable to estimate that I'm far more 'aware' of the majority of software primitives than most average people who don't work/recreate in the software field; but the opposite is likely true when comparing myself to the average github user. This is intended to serve as a public journaling, and open source "seed" from which much smarter and more practiced developers and engineers may one day create, extend, or upgrade LLM, MLM, and NLM systems to contribute to human progress. 
// I'd like to also take the opportunity to acknowledge in advance that I am of the assumption that similar mechanisms or processes are likely to exist. in which case I am hopeful that my efforts to improve my efficiency will be supplementative to theirs.
